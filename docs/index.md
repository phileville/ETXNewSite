**Its almost time for EdgeTX Fest 2023!** 

We are currently searching for a great location in central Europe to host this special event. If you are a member of an RC Model club, we extend a warm invitation to you to host the EdgeTX development team at your club's flying field, as we come together to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of EdgeTX.

Our target timeframe for this memorable occasion is the first half of September.  To ensure convenience for everyone, we prefer a location within a 500km radius of Erfurt, Germany. Rest assured, all expenses associated with the event will be covered by the EdgeTX Team. We are also open to collaborating with your club's planned event, adding an extra layer of excitement to the festivities.

If If you are interested or would like some more details, please visit the event page at: [https://edgetx.org/fest2023](https://edgetx.org/fest2023). Let's come together and make this event truly special!

**Developer Discussion Hour** 

On Sunday, April 2nd, 2023 from 7:00 PM UTC to 8:00 PM UTC, we are having our second live Developer-Discussion-Hour here in EdgeTX Discord stage channel DevDiscussionHour. To better cater developers from various parts of the globe, we are alternating with the timeslots between the sessions.  Feel free to join and ask EdgeTX developmental related questions in a live voice-chat to some of EdgeTX core team members joining the session. Please bear in mind that this session is purely for developmental questions and unrelated topics will be explicitly not handled. During the session you can raise a hand and ask your questions directly, or post them beforehand and also during the session in the DevDiscussionHour stage chat window: [EdgeTX Discord: DevDiscussionHour](https://discord.com/channels/839849772864503828/1081860475781914624/1086984571763040296).
