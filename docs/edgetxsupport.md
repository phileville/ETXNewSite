##How radio manufacturers can get a version of EdgeTX for their new radio hardware.

If you are a radio manufacturer and are interested in using EdgeTX as the firmware for your radio, there are several ways to achieve this. Under the open-source GPL, anyone can use EdgeTX or create a modified version of EdgeTX to use. The only stipulation is that the source code for the modified version of EdgeTX must be made available for everyone to see and use.
There are two ways to can get a version of EdgeTX that supports your new radio hardware:


1. Create your own branch of EdgeTX and make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself and publish it yourself (keeping in mind that your new branch must be made available for others to use.). In this case, you are responsible for the maintenance and bug fixing of your firmware. 
In this case, in order to prevent confusion by the users, you may not refer to the software as EdgeTX, but rather “a custom branch of EdgeTX v2.4.x”.  Additionally, you may not use the EdgeTX logo for product marketing or packaging.


2. Make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, submit a pull request to the EdgeTX team for review.  If approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch of EdgeTX where it will be published and distributed as part of the normal release schedule. In this case, hardware-specific features and bug fixes will be completed on a capacity-available basis by the EdgeTX team.
If you do not have the know-how or resources to make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, then you can contact the EdgeTX project steering committee to get assistance with finding a developer that is willing to do the needed work as a commission. However, the agreed commission will be between you and the developer, not EdgeTX.


All manufacturers that are using EdgeTX are encouraged to participate in the EdgeTX partnership program.  Under this program, hardware-specific features and bug fixes will be completed on a priority basis by the EdgeTX team. More information about the benefits and requirements of the partnership program can be seen here: [EdgeTX partnership program.](partnershipprogram.md)
