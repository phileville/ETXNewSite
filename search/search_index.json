The project steering committee was initially formed by project contributors appointed by the founder of the project. At the creation of the PSC, it was agreed that the PSC members shall be elected every year. </p> <p>On December 7th of 2022, elections were held in accordance with the project bylaws and as a result, the following people were voted to be the on PSC for 2023:</p> <p>Raphael Coeffic (pafleraf) - Re-elected Robert Janiszewski (JimB40) - Re-elected Peter Feerick (pfeerick) - Re-elected Risto K\u00f5iva (Risto) \u2013 Re-elected Richard Li (Richard Li) \u2013 Re-elected Phil Eville (EZRipFPV) \u2013 Re-elected Malte Langermann (Malte) \u2013 New member  </p> <p>On the 8th of January 2023, the new PSC met for the first time.

So far we have only published the EdgeTX user manual for color screen radios. However, the user manual for black &amp; white radios and Companion will be added shortly as well. </p> <p>You can take a look at the site here: https://edgetx.gitbook.io/edgetx-user-manual/</p> <p>We are looking for contributors of new content for the How-to section, people to work on the user manual for black &amp; white radios, and the EdgeTX Companion user manual. We also need people to proofread new content as well as work to keep the manuals up to date with the software changes in EdgeTX.  </p> <p>If any of this sound interesting to you and you happen to have some spare time and energy, we would love to hear from you!

Visitors could also participate in several small competitions, such as RC Car bowling and Tiny Whoop balloon popping. Overall, the event was a great success.</p> <p>Thank you to all that came out to the EdgeTX Fest to celebrate the first year of EdgeTX with us. Your attendance made for a fun and enjoyable event!

However, with the change to the FreeRTOS operating system in EdgeTX v2.5, additional unplanned efforts are required that may cause us to shift support for those two radios until EdgeTX v2.7 (Spring Edition).  </p> <p>We understand that there is great interest in EdgeTX and EdgeTX Companion support for those two radios, and you can rest assured that the teams at TBS and EdgeTX are working together to make this happen.</p> <p>Nov. 4th, 2021</p> <p>EdgeTX is now accepting donations via Open Collective</p> <p>If you would like to support EdgeTX financially, we have a donation system setup at Open Collective. All money that is donated will be used for our planned online-build system as well as to help developers purchase needed hardware (e.g. radio systems &amp; development equipment). You can send a one-time donation or set up a recurring donation via the following link: https://opencollective.com/edgetx/donate</p> <p>The usage of the money will be reported at OpenCollective and will be transparent for all to see what the money is being used for.
